# Interfaces

Interfaces are contracts that define a set of methods, properties, events, and indexers that a class or struct must implement. Interfaces can inherit from one or more interfaces, and the derived interface inherits the members from its base interfaces.

## Interfaces benefits

- Abstraction: Interfaces can help achieve abstraction
- Loose coupling: Interfaces can help develop loosely coupled systems
- Multiple inheritance: Interfaces can support multiple inheritance
- Easier testing: Interfaces can enable mocking for better unit testing
- Dependency injection: Interfaces can help implement dependency injection
- Polymorphic behavior: Interfaces can allow for polymorphic behavior

## Drawbacks of Overusing Interfaces

While interfaces are designed to simplify and abstract specific functionalities, overusing them can ironically lead to a more convoluted codebase. When there are interfaces for every minor functionality or behavior, developers can find themselves navigating through a maze of contracts to understand the flow of the application.
